Project Summary: Custom Microprocessor Emulation with Arduino Mega 2560This project involves designing and building a microcomputer system with a complete set of components including:* Microprocessor Unit* Address Bus and Address Decoding Circuit* Control Bus and Data Bus* Random Access Memory (RAM)* Input/Output (I/O) Interface* Interrupt Structure* Keypad Input DeviceThe microprocessor functionality is emulated using an Arduino Mega 2560 board. Firmware developed in C language is loaded onto the Arduino Mega 2560 to simulate microprocessor operations, allowing for a functional and fully operational microcomputer system.This setup demonstrates hands-on experience with both hardware design and software development, integrating various electronic components and microcontroller programming to create a comprehensive emulation environment.
